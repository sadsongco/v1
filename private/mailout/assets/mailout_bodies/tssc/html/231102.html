        <h3>
          Dear
          <!--{{name}}-->
        </h3>
        <p>If you're on the Unbelievable Truth mailing list as well, apologies for getting a very similar email twice. The reason for posting to this list is there's a new user area on the website at <a href="<!--{{host}}-->/user_area/"><!--{{host}}-->/user_area/</a>. Apart from a stream of a song not available anywhere else to complete our playlist of the set from our recent Almost Here shows, there's also a new version of <b>Directions</b> from <b>miseryguts</b>, with re-recorded vocals from Andy in the wake of us enjoying playing it as part of the supports we did for the recent shows. You'll have to register with an email and username, doing so will automatically add you to the Unbelievable Truth mailing list because we're heartless corporate data harvesters.</p>
        <p>Looking towards the future, Unbelievable Truth are in the process of bringing our albums back under our own control to release through The Sad Song Co. label. While Almost Here will be more complicated, we have retrieved the rights for our second album <b>sorrythankyou</b> from Shifty Disco who originally released it. It is available again on streaming services from Friday 3rd November. I guess it's kind of exciting - it's like release day all over again!</p>
        <p>There are still a few t-shirts and posters left from the <b>Almost Here</b> shows, head to <a href="https://unbelievable-truth.sumupstore.com/">https://unbelievable-truth.sumupstore.com/</a> if you fancy a browse. Some random CD singles from that era, a rare promo CD of Almost Here and Andy's excellent solo album (featuring Nigel and Jason) <b>Simple</b> are also available.</p>
        <img src="<!--{{host}}-->/assets/images/front.jpg" alt="The front view of a t-shirt, depicting two people on a train, one resting their head on the other's shoulder. The one whose face is visible has a mysterious but calm smile on their face. The Unbelievable Truth logo runs down the side" />
        <img src="<!--{{host}}-->/assets/images/poster.jpg" alt="The back view of a t-shirt, with two lines of text with the dates and venues of gigs" />
        <p>Writing is continuing. It's an interesting mix of slow going, due to geopgraphy and life commitments making finding time to get together challenging, and very fast, given that when we can get together the chemistry is as potent as it was in the earliest days of the band and material comes out almost too fast to capture. Which is nice. We all look forward to sharing it with you. If there's anything of mine left over who knows, I might feel inspired to put together another TSSC album. But I'm certainly not holding my breath.</p>
