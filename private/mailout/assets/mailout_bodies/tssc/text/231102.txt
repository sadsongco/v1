Dear <!--{{name}}-->,

If you're on the Unbelievable Truth mailing list as well, apologies for getting a very similar email twice. The reason for posting to this list is there's a new user area on the website at http://127.0.0.1:8000/user_area/. Apart from a stream of a song not available anywhere else to complete our playlist of the set from our recent Almost Here shows, there's also a new version of Directions from miseryguts, with re-recorded vocals from Andy in the wake of us enjoying playing it as part of the supports we did for the recent shows. You'll have to register with an email and username, doing so will automatically add you to the Unbelievable Truth mailing list because we're heartless corporate data harvesters.

Looking towards the future, Unbelievable Truth are in the process of bringing our albums back under our own control to release through The Sad Song Co. label. While Almost Here will be more complicated, we have retrieved the rights for our 2000 sophomore album sorrythankyou from Shifty Disco who originally released it. It is available again on streaming services from Friday 3rd November. I guess it's kind of exciting - it's like release day all over again!

There are still a few t-shirts and posters left from the Almost Here shows, head to https://unbelievable-truth.sumupstore.com/ if you fancy a browse. Some random CD singles from that era, a rare promo CD of Almost Here and Andy's excellent solo album (featuring Nigel and Jason) Simple are also available.

Writing is continuing. It's an interesting mix of slow going, due to geopgraphy and life commitments making finding time to get together challenging, and very fast, given that when we can get together the chemistry is as potent as it was in the earliest days of the band and material comes out almost too fast to capture. Which is nice. We all look forward to sharing it with you. If there's anything of mine left over who knows, I might feel inspired to put together another TSSC album. But I'm certainly not holding my breath.

Tinkety tonk, and down with the Nazis
