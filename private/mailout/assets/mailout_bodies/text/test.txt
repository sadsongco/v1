Dear <!--{{name}}-->

As you may know we organised a show in Oxford at The Jericho Tavern, and we quite pleasantly taken aback when it sold out in 3 minutes. Many people seemed disappointed by not being able to get tickets, so it seemed we should do something else.

So we're playing another Almost Here 25th Anniversary show show: Wednesday 20th September 2023 at Bush Hall, London. Tickets will go on sale [DATE AND TIME HERE] from [TICKET LINK HERE]. Lineup for the show will be the same...
- a headline set of all of Almost Here, and many of the b-sides and extra tracks from that period, with Andy, Jason and Nigel joined by long-time live guitarist and bon vivant Jim Crosskey, and new-ish keyboarding wiz Richard Payne
- a support set of other songs from our career played as a 3 piece

We hope you will join us, it's a beautiful venue in west London that should will suit our music well.

Thanks for being there for us. This email list will generally inform you of any big news, but for more regular updates you can join us on our website or your favoured social media:
