Dear <!--{{name}}-->

Playing the two recent Almost Here 25th anniversary shows in Oxford and London was an amazing and special experience. If you were there, thank you so much for coming. The love and appreciaton coming off the audiences was humbling and joyous in equal measure.

Exclusively for these shows we produced a limited number of t-shirts (that you can see pictured above) and posters (image below). We have a few left, and I've set up an online shop in case anyone fancied it. We made the t-shirts with very high quality Stanley / Stella blanks, and the poster is screen printed onto heavyweight uncoated paper. The online shop is at https://unbelievable-truth.sumupstore.com/, and for the first two weeks shipping is free worldwide for any order over Â£5 (just because packing and sending just one of the CD singles we also have available would likely actually lose us money)

As for the future, Andy, Jason and I are already happily ensconsed in writing new material. I have no idea if we will ever finish it, or release it, or tour it. I certainly hope so (it's sounding wonderful to my ears already, even at this early stage), but always in motion is the future. We did record the recent shows, I don't think we're planning an official release (probably too many rough edges for that) but I might mix a few for public consumption. Keep an eye on this list and our socials for news.
