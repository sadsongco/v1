Dear <!--{{name}}-->

Looking towards the future, we are in the process of bringing our albums back under our own control. While Almost Here will be more complicated, we have retrieved the rights for our 2000 sophomore album sorrythankyou from Shifty Disco who originally released it. It is available again on streaming services from Friday 3rd November. I guess it's kind of exciting - it's like release day all over again!

There's a new user area on the website at <!--{{host}}-->/user_area/. So far there's only a stream of a song not available anywhere else to complete our playlist of the set from our recent Almost Here shows, and a 'new' track. In inverted commas because it's the song Directions from the first The Sad Song Co. (Nigel's solo albums that also heavily feature Jason) album miseryguts, but with re-recorded vocals from Andy in the wake of us enjoying playing it as part of the supports we did for the recent shows. You'll have to register with an email and username, but since you already appear to be on this list I'm guessing that isn't going to bother you.

There are still a few t-shirts and posters left from the Almost Here shows, head to https://unbelievable-truth.sumupstore.com/ if you fancy a browse. Some random CD singles from that era, a rare promo CD of Almost Here and Andy's excellent solo album (featuring Nigel and Jason) Simple are also available.
