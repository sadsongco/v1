Hi there Test Name

When we decided to do a show to commemorate the album Almost Here, that we are all very proud of, we had no idea if anyone would be interested. So it was a nice, but totally unexpected, surprise when The Jericho Tavern in Oxford sold out in 5 minutes.

Though there were no initial plans for another show, we didn't want to disappoint people who weren't quick enough on the trigger. So to that end, we're playing again at Bush Hall, London on Wednesday 20th September 2023.

Tickets will be on sale 10am (UK time) on Friday 7th July from https://myticket.co.uk/artists/unbelievable-truth (you've got this link before anyone else because you're on this mailing list and therefore by definition special). The gig will once again be Almost Here along with associated b-sides and extra tracks, including Andy's favourite song of ours From This Height, with long time live guitarist Jim Crosskey and new-ish addition, keyboardist Richard Payne.

As in Oxford the support act will be Unbelievable Truth as a 3 piece playing songs from sorrythankyou, Misc. Music, Andy's amazing solo record Simple and perhaps some other surprises.

We're very excited to be playing again. Hope to see you there.

Andy, Jason and Nigel
